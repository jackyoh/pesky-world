# Top Down Game

## What is this

A 2D game project made with [Unity](https://unity.com/), as a way to consolidate my understanding of the different elements of game development before my upcoming game development.

## Is this a real game then?

Nope. It's runnable and you can play with it, but you can't do much with it. And it's not published.

## Development

- Install [UnityHub and Unity](https://unity.com/download)
  (This project was created in a LTS version of Unity `2021.3.16f1`)
- Clone this repo and open the directory **Pesky World** from Unity editor

## Here is a list of the features included in this proejct

- Version control via Git and GitHub
- Health bar UI and basic player damage system
- NPC movement via waypoints
- Various NPC animations including running, sitting and making phone calls
